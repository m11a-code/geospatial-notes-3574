Tasks to complete:
  1. Facebook login utilizing Titanium.Facebook API.  Login screen will consist of a button that enables the user to enter their facebook credentials, accept or reject permissions, and then sign into the app.
  1. Home screen with 'Inbox', 'Outbox', 'Options' icons which open respective windows.  These will just be simple buttons that open blank windows.  The back button will return from the blank windows to the home screen.
  1. GPS readout screen indicating x, y, accuracy, and bearing/speed (if possible).  These will just be text readouts that update on a UI button push.
  1. Client-side ability to store and recall saved locations:  this will be a button that stores a location (user entered, will be GPS-driven later) with a name via a text field, or brings up a window of previous locations and corresponding names.
