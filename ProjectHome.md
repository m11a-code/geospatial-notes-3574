# Overview #

This project is designed to give users the ability to 'post' notes at a GPS coordinate corresponding to their current position.  It will also allow users to view these notes.  The ability to view the notes may have a geospatial coordinate.  For example, one must be within 500m of the note in order to view it.

## Complexity ##

This program will require several features which are unfamiliar to the programmers.  These features may include:
-A way to have phones communicate with a server to store notes
-The ability to tag notes at a particular location
-An overlaying of the notes on some other application, such as google maps, in order for the user to view the location where the note is, rather than just the GPS location.
-Some variance in the ability to view notes: either in a list format, or on a map.
-Public and private notes, such that one may see/post notes from anyone, or only from members of private groups.
-A possible limit to the length of time the notes will exist
-Ability to extend the range of notes (ie. 500m, 2km, 10km)


## Novelty ##

Services like Facebook allow users to 'check in' to locations, but any notes they make are put in facebook.  There is no feature to view these notes separately from facebook, or on a map.  Additionally, it is not possible to view notes for a given area based on your proximity to the area, or to view public notes without knowing the existence of the public poster, and joining that poster.  This application takes the old-fashioned idea of a teacher leaving a note on the door for students to know a class is cancelled, and extends that in to the digital realm with other potential applications.
