# Installation #

An APK is available from the Downloads tab.

# New features #
  * User can now enter a note and associate that note with a location. That note can also be recalled based on the location. Start by typing a note, some arbitrary location parameters, and then hit "Save Location." Repeat with a different note and location. Now, if you type location parameters you entered previously and click "Recall Note," that note should show up in the text box.
  * Settings menu has been created. There is a slider box to adjust the view note radius. Pressing "Note Filters" will allow the user to select which notes they will be able to see.
  * Facebook friends list, with alternating row colors. User can click on a friend, which will open a new screen to interact with that friend.


# Changes #
  * With regard to feedback from build cycle 1, the back button has been implemented. Clicking the back button should now take the user back to the app's main screen, rather than having the app close.
  * Color scheme has been changed


# Other notes / Known issues #
  * The Friends list will only be available after logging into Facebook. It will take a while to load, however.
  * After clicking a facebook friend, the picture that shows up doesn't correspond to the selected friend.
  * Make sure GPS is enabled on your phone.
